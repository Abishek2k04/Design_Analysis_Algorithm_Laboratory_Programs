function main():
    Input the number of vertices n
    Create a 2D array graph[n][n]
    Initialize graph[][] with large values (100) for all edges, and 0 for diagonal elements
    Accept input for the weights of edges between vertices from the user
    
    Call floydWarshall(graph, n)
    
    Output the shortest path matrix
